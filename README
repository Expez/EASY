EASY is an Evolutionary Algorithm System created for the course IT3108
at the Norwegian University of Technology and Science, NTNU, in the
spring of 2012.

This project uses Ivy for dependency management and Ant for build
management.

To run the project call the "run" target, by issuing the command "Ant
run".  Some other Ant targets are compile, test, and jar. The "jar" target
creates a .jar file for the project.
